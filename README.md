# Roulette

## Description
This console application is designed to simulate a roulette table. A player will be asked to enter the amount of money they brought to the table. After they have done so, they can enter the amount they want to bet and how they want to bet. They can go all in and bet it all on black or play for longer, placing a variety of bets. The simulation will keep track of all of the money they win or lose and update them on how much they currently have and how much they have when they leave the table.
